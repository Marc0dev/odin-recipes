    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it is al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto sauce. In a food processor or blender, combine the fresh basil leaves, garlic cloves, pine nuts, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Pulse the mixture until it forms a coarse paste.</li>
        <li>Gradually drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to blend until the sauce reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. You may need to scrape down the sides of the processor or blender as needed.</li>
        <li>Season the pesto sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the flavors as desired.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked pasta, reserving a small amount of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the drained pasta with the prepared pesto sauce. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce and help it coat the pasta evenly.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta al pesto immediately, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese, fresh basil leaves, and any desired optional ingredients.</li>

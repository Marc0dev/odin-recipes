    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with alternating layers of pasta sheets, meat sauce, and cheese. The pasta sheets are typically pre-cooked, and the meat sauce can be made with ground beef, sausage, or a combination of both, cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs. Each layer is topped with a generous amount of cheese, usually mozzarella and Parmesan. The entire dish is baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly, resulting in a delicious and hearty meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>Ground beef or sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the specified temperature according to the lasagna sheets' packaging instructions.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and continue cooking until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the skillet. Season with Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna sheets on top of the sauce, covering it completely.</li>
        <li>Spoon a generous amount of the meat sauce over the lasagna sheets, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, alternating between lasagna sheets, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese until you've used up all the ingredients. Finish with a layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it's tightly sealed to trap the steam.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve the lasagna while it's still hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
